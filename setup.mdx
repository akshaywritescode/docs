title: 'Setup'
description: "Rangoli does not require any additional libraries or tools, you just need to copy & paste component code. Since it is based on shadcn, make sure you have shadcn installed. For more details, visit the [shadcn documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)."

## Make Sure Dependencies

```json package.json
{
  "postcss": "^8",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
  "typescript": "^5",
  "lucide-react": "^0.474.0",
  "tailwindcss-animate": "^1.0.7",

}
```
